# Getting Started with Create React App

Welcome to the website to manage and create employees. This project aims to create a complete and responsive web application using React, TypeScript, Redux, and Tailwind.

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to convert a plugin JQuery to React and then import it into your project for use.

## Getting started!

HRNet uses the following tech stack:

- [Plugin dropdown HRNet v1.1.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hrnet_plugin_boudra_tristan)
- [PrimeReact v10.5.3](https://primereact.org/)
- [React v18.2.0](https://react.dev/)
- [Node v21.1.0](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Instructions Front-end

1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/Tristan-Boudra/OC-project14)
2. Clone the repo into your computer
3. Open a terminal window in the cloned project
4. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies

```

Your application should now be running at http://localhost:3000!
